                <p>
                    <strong>In collaboration with Dr. Luigi Dilillo, University of Montpellier, France</strong><br><br>
                    Radiation-induced effects, such as Single Event Upsets (SEU) and Total Ionizing Dose (TID), pose significant challenges for electronic systems operating in space and other harsh environments. This internship will focus on extending an existing RISC-V-based System-on-Chip to a multi-core architecture in order to enhance performance and fault tolerance against radiation effects. The work involves modifying the existing VHDL design to support multiple cores, implementing inter-core communication and synchronization, and integrating fault-mitigation techniques. Candidates should have experience in VHDL, processor architecture, C programming, and microcontrollers.

                <p>
                    This thesis will investigate how modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can be exploited to reveal sensitive data or run unauthorized code, all without requiring physical access or elevated permissions. By studying GPU-specific features, such as caching techniques, memory management, and parallel processing pipelines, the project aims to uncover new attack vectors and demonstrate them through proof-of-concept exploits. Finally, the research will suggest countermeasures and improved design strategies to enhance GPU security against these emerging threats.

                    This thesis aims to develop a Linux kernel module enabling fault injection into selected processes or programs running on a processor. The tool will simulate adverse conditions, such as ionizing radiation, that affect memory and computation. The solution may involve a kernel module, a small fork, or a patch to the Linux kernel, allowing controlled or random fault injection for automated and repeatable testing. The system will help evaluate application resilience to faults and will include a configurable logging mechanism at multiple levels to track performance and events.

                    This thesis investigates the development of new transient execution attacks (TEAs) that exploit microarchitectural vulnerabilities in modern processors. The research will focus on identifying weaknesses in the execution pipeline, speculative execution mechanisms, and related hardware features, demonstrating how these can be leveraged to bypass traditional security measures.

                <p>
                    Modern microprocessors have advanced features like cache hierarchies, acceleration units, out-of-order and speculative execution: on the one hand, all these features dramatically increase systems performance but, on the other hand, they expose the system to a new menace: the so-called Microarchitectural Side-Channel Attacks (MSCAs), such as Spectre and Meltdown. Protecting a system from these attacks is extremely challenging, and this becomes even harder in the embedded scenario, where Operating System support and multiple cores may be unavailable. This thesis aims at exploring the feasibility of adopting hardware performance counters (HPCs) monitoring and deep learning (DL)-based anomaly detection (for example Recurrent Neural Networks) to identify the execution of MSCAs in embedded microprocessors. The basic idea is to add a Security Checking module between the microprocessor and the main memory to observe the fetching activity and the HPCs. The introduced checker shall neither interferes with the nominal activity of the microprocessor nor requires any modification of the microprocessor itself. Existing RISC-V microprocessors could be considered as a target hardware platform.
