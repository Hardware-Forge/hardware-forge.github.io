                <p>
                    This work focuses on conducting an in-depth security evaluation of the OpenTitan framework, an open-source silicon root of trust designed to reinforce trusted computing on hardware-level systems. The research will begin with a thorough review of OpenTitan’s architecture, security features, and implementation details to identify potential weakness points. Building on this understanding, the project will employ systematic testing methods, including static code analysis, fuzzing, and hardware penetration testing, to uncover vulnerabilities and assess the impact of any discovered flaws on system integrity.

                    Radiation-induced effects, such as Single Event Upsets (SEU) and Total Ionizing Dose (TID), pose significant challenges for electronic systems operating in space and other harsh environments. This internship will focus on extending an existing RISC-V-based System-on-Chip to a multi-core architecture in order to enhance performance and fault tolerance against radiation effects. The work involves modifying the existing VHDL design to support multiple cores, implementing inter-core communication and synchronization, and integrating fault-mitigation techniques. Candidates should have experience in VHDL, processor architecture, C programming, and microcontrollers.

                    The Core Flight System is an advanced software architecture based on the mission operation services of the CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems). Developed by NASA, this software is designed to support space operations and system integration for various aerospace missions, thanks to its modularity that allows updates similar to smartphone applications. NASA's cFS is a software framework intended to support space operations and system integration across diverse aerospace missions. Thesis/Internship Objectives: The thesis and internship activities are designed to investigate the effectiveness of NASA's Core Flight System (cFS) in managing electro-optical payloads on CubeSat platforms. This evaluation specifically focuses on the performance of the cFS when operational on a representative target computing platform for data handling and processing, developed by TSD-Space. Specifically, the focus will be on implementing a cFS application that manages image acquisition operations, integrating monitoring and control services performed through the cFS framework and the C programming language.

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>
                    <strong>In collaboration with TDS-Space and the European Space Agency</strong><br><br>
                    The activities will be conducted in the framework of the FOPAC project, led by TSD-Space and founded by the Italian Space Agency. The FOPAC’s goal is to develop an active motion control system for the focal plane of electro-optical payloads adopted in Earth observation applications to enhance image quality in terms of spatial resolution and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). These platforms often feature telescopes with limited focal length and aperture, and less accurate attitude control systems. FOPAC can be utilized for implementing active focal plane stabilization techniques and pixel-shifting acquisition mode. Active stabilization mitigates motion blur effects due to platform instability and enables the adoption of advanced Time Delay Integration (TDI) techniques for SNR improvements. The FOPAC project incorporates the implementation of real-time onboard 2D image correlation algorithms to estimate the instantaneous motion of the focal plane and stabilize it. This compensates for the limited attitude control performance of small platforms, which significantly impacts image quality. Focal plane stabilization, capable of compensating for platform jitter—a source of instability—allows for increased exposure times, thereby enhancing the SNR. Alternatively, with the same exposure time, it reduces motion blur, thus improving the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). The primary activity of the candidate will be to explore and survey different approaches in 2D image correlation and motion estimation, focusing on new algorithms based on AI. The selected algorithm will be accelerated on an FPGA platform for real-time execution.

        <div class="card-body">

                <strong>In collaboration with TDS-Space and the European Space Agency</strong><br><br>
                In the field of Earth observation, the digital Time-Delay Integration (TDI) acquisition technique is crucial for enhancing the quality of satellite images. This method utilizes electro-optical payloads to capture sub-stripes or partially overlapping images. By digitally summing the signals encoded in the pixels of different sub-stripes that correspond to the same ground point, it is possible to reduce uncorrelated noise and significantly increase signal amplitude. This process leads to a substantial improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and, consequently, the overall quality of the image. However, the digital TDI technique requires capturing multiple images of the same sample, thereby increasing the resources needed for data storage and transmission to ground stations. By performing digital TDI operations directly onboard the spacecraft, it is possible to drastically minimize the volume of data to be stored and maximize the efficiency of bandwidth use for downlink. Digital TDI activity essentially includes image alignment, which is a prerequisite to ensure that the sum of signals occurs exclusively among pixels corresponding to the same ground sample. During the internship at TSD-Space, the candidate will explore various methods for digital image registration, including advanced approaches that incorporate artificial intelligence. The selected algorithm will be accelerated on an FPGA platform for real-time execution, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of the TDI process.

                <p>
                    Modern microprocessors have advanced features like cache hierarchies, acceleration units, out-of-order and speculative execution: on the one hand, all these features dramatically increase systems performance but, on the other hand, they expose the system to a new menace: the so-called Microarchitectural Side-Channel Attacks (MSCAs), such as Spectre and Meltdown. Protecting a system from these attacks is extremely challenging, and this becomes even harder in the embedded scenario, where Operating System support and multiple cores may be unavailable. This thesis aims at exploring the feasibility of adopting hardware performance counters (HPCs) monitoring and deep learning (DL)-based anomaly detection (for example Recurrent Neural Networks) to identify the execution of MSCAs in embedded microprocessors. The basic idea is to add a Security Checking module between the microprocessor and the main memory to observe the fetching activity and the HPCs. The introduced checker shall neither interferes with the nominal activity of the microprocessor nor requires any modification of the microprocessor itself. Existing RISC-V microprocessors could be considered as a target hardware platform.
